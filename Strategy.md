# Exen Protocol Strategy Documentation

## 🌐 The Vision: Decentralized Internet Banking Infrastructure

The internet economy requires true internet banking infrastructure. Today, it remains impossible for most people to achieve fully onchain financial independence. Traditional banks gatekeep access to capital through legacy credit systems that fail to recognize on-chain reputation and creditworthiness. The infrastructure for decentralized underwriting is almost entirely absent.

**Exen's mission is to build distributed internet banking infrastructure for the blockchain era.** We're constructing an internet-native lending system backed by on-chain reputation and transparent collateral mechanics—eliminating the need for centralized institutions to determine who deserves access to capital.

Money didn't originate from barter; it originated as credit. Money is fundamentally a social ledger. To achieve true independence from fiat banking, we need a decentralized social ledger—one where trust is earned on-chain through participation and collateral backing, not granted by institutions.

Most leading research confirms that decentralized finance still lacks reliable reputation-based lending mechanisms. **Exen solves this** by creating a transparent, algorithmic lending pool where collateral is verifiable on-chain, interest rates are market-driven, and all protocol revenue is redistributed to the community that underwrites it.

We are building the financial infrastructure that enables the next billion people to access capital without permission from centralized banks.

## Executive Summary

The Exen Protocol implements a revolutionary three-pillar system that simultaneously rewards token holders with SOL distributions, maintains chart health through algorithmic buybacks, and enables a sustainable lending ecosystem. This creates a multi-layer value generation system where community rewards, technical performance, and financial utility work in harmony.

## 🎯 Core Strategy: The 25/25/50 Split

### Philosophy
We've evolved beyond simple holder rewards to create a complete ecosystem. By strategically allocating fees across immediate holder value, chart stability, and lending infrastructure, we build a self-sustaining protocol that benefits all participants.

### Implementation
```
Total Creator Fees (100%)
├── 25% → Direct Holder Rewards (SOL Airdrops)
├── 25% → Algorithmic Chart Buyback Support
└── 50% → Lending Pool Infrastructure
```

## 💰 Reward Engine (25% of Fees)

### Distribution Mechanism
- **Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- **Currency**: SOL (Solana native token)
- **Eligibility**: All token holders (no minimum threshold)
- **Calculation**: Proportional to token holdings

### How the Rewards Are Split

Think of it like a pie. Each reward cycle, that 25% of creator fees becomes a whole pie that gets divided among all holders. The bigger your slice of the total token supply, the bigger your slice of that SOL pie.

- Hold **50% of the supply**? You get **50% of the rewards pie** 🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧
- Hold **25% of the supply**? You get **25% of the rewards pie** 🥧🥧🥧
- Hold **10% of the supply**? You get **10% of the rewards pie** 🥧

It's perfectly proportional. Your share of the rewards matches your share of the token supply - simple, fair, and transparent.

### Real Example

Let's say there are 4 holders and the rewards pot has **2.5 SOL** to distribute (25% allocation of a 10 SOL fee):

| Holder | Token Supply % | SOL Reward |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| 1st Holder | 50% | 1.25 SOL (50% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 2nd Holder | 25% | 0.625 SOL (25% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 3rd Holder | 15% | 0.375 SOL (15% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 4th Holder | 10% | 0.25 SOL (10% of 2.5 SOL) |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **2.50 SOL** ✓ |

### Smart Contract Logic
```rust
// Reward distribution for 25% allocation
pub fn distribute_rewards() {
    let total_fees = get_creator_fees();
    let reward_pool = total_fees * 0.25; // 25% for rewards
    
    for holder in token_holders {
        let holder_balance = get_balance(holder);
        let total_supply = get_total_supply();
        let reward_amount = (holder_balance / total_supply) * reward_pool;
        
        transfer_sol(holder, reward_amount);
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Immediate Value**: Holders see returns within 15 minutes
- **No Staking Required**: Passive income for all holders
- **Transparent**: All distributions on-chain
- **Compound Effect**: Rewards can be reinvested

## 📈 Chart Buyback Engine (25% of Fees)

### Technical Analysis Framework

#### 1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) Analysis
```python
def calculate_rsi(prices, period=14):
    """Calculate RSI for momentum analysis"""
    deltas = np.diff(prices)
    gains = np.where(deltas > 0, deltas, 0)
    losses = np.where(deltas < 0, -deltas, 0)
    
    avg_gains = np.mean(gains[-period:])
    avg_losses = np.mean(losses[-period:])
    
    rs = avg_gains / avg_losses if avg_losses != 0 else 0
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

# RSI thresholds for buy signals
RSI_OVERSOLD = 30
RSI_OVERSOLD_STRONG = 20
RSI_NEUTRAL = 50
```

#### 2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
```python
def calculate_macd(prices, fast=12, slow=26, signal=9):
    """Calculate MACD for trend analysis"""
    ema_fast = calculate_ema(prices, fast)
    ema_slow = calculate_ema(prices, slow)
    
    macd_line = ema_fast - ema_slow
    signal_line = calculate_ema(macd_line, signal)
    histogram = macd_line - signal_line
    
    return macd_line, signal_line, histogram

# MACD buy signals
MACD_BULLISH_CROSS = "macd_line > signal_line"
MACD_HISTOGRAM_POSITIVE = "histogram > 0"
```

#### 3. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
```python
def analyze_timeframes(price_data):
    """Analyze 1m and 5m timeframes for confirmation"""
    rsi_1m = calculate_rsi(price_data['1m'], 14)
    rsi_5m = calculate_rsi(price_data['5m'], 14)
    
    macd_1m = calculate_macd(price_data['1m'])
    macd_5m = calculate_macd(price_data['5m'])
    
    # Confirmation required from both timeframes
    return {
        'rsi_confirmed': rsi_1m < 30 and rsi_5m < 35,
        'macd_confirmed': macd_1m['bullish'] and macd_5m['bullish'],
        'buy_signal': rsi_confirmed and macd_confirmed
    }
```

### Buyback Execution Algorithm
```python
def execute_support_buyback():
    """Execute algorithmic buyback when conditions are met"""
    analysis = analyze_timeframes(get_price_data())
    
    if analysis['buy_signal']:
        # Calculate buy amount based on available funds
        available_funds = get_buyback_support_funds()
        buy_amount = calculate_optimal_buy_size(available_funds)
        
        # Execute buy order
        execute_buy_order(buy_amount)
        
        # Log transaction for transparency
        log_support_buyback(buy_amount, analysis)
```

### Risk Management
- **Maximum Buy Size**: 10% of available buyback funds per trade
- **Cooldown Period**: 5 minutes between consecutive buys
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic if RSI > 70 (overbought territory)
- **High Volatility**: Reduce position sizes by 50%
- **Low Liquidity**: Pause automated buybacks

## 🏦 Lending Pool System (50% of Fees)

### Pool Activation & Mechanics
- **Minimum Liquidity Threshold**: $50,000 USD equivalent
- **Pool Status**: Inactive until threshold is reached, then auto-activates
- **Funding Source**: 50% of all creator fees continuously added
- **Currency**: Loans issued in USD stablecoin
- **Target APY**: 12-18% (variable based on utilization)
- **Maximum LTV**: 60%

### Revenue Generation Model

The lending pool generates revenue through interest payments on loans. Users borrowing USD stablecoin pay interest, which becomes the protocol's profit.

**Interest Rate Formula:**
```
Borrowing Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization Rate × Risk Premium)
Base Rate: 8%
Risk Premium: up to 10%
Result: Variable 8-18% interest on all outstanding loans
```

**Example:**
- Pool has $100,000 available
- $60,000 is borrowed (60% utilization)
- Average borrowing rate: 14% APY
- **Annual interest revenue: $60,000 × 14% = $8,400 USD**

### Revenue Distribution Engine

**ALL lending pool revenue is redistributed through two channels:**

```
Lending Interest Revenue (100%)
├── 50% → Holder Rewards (Additional SOL Distribution)
│   └── Distributed to all token holders
│   └── Same 15-minute distribution cycle as creator fees
│   └── Proportional to token holdings
│
└── 50% → Chart Buyback Support (Enhanced Buying Power)
    └── Funds algorithmic buyback engine
    └── Executed via RSI/MACD confirmation signals
    └── Strengthens chart health and price floor
```

**Real Example:**
- Monthly lending interest revenue: $700 USD
- $350 → New SOL holder rewards (distributed 15-minutely)
- $350 → Chart buyback support (deployed algorithmically)

### Per-User Borrow Limits

Each user has an individual borrow limit calculated based on their collateral deposit and the 60% LTV ratio:

```rust
pub fn calculate_borrow_limit(collateral_amount: u64) -> u64 {
    let collateral_value_usd = get_current_token_price() * collateral_amount;
    let ltv_ratio = 0.60; // 60% LTV maximum
    
    let max_borrow = (collateral_value_usd * ltv_ratio) as u64;
    
    // Cap per-user limit to prevent concentration risk
    let per_user_cap = 500_000; // $500k USD max per user
    
    min(max_borrow, per_user_cap)
}
```

**Example Borrow Limits with 60% LTV:**

| Collateral Deposited | Token Price | Collateral Value | Max Borrow (60%) | Actual Limit |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 100,000 Exen | $0.10 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $6,000 |
| 1,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $100,000 | $60,000 | $60,000 |
| 5,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $500,000 | $300,000 | $300,000 |
| 10,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $1,000,000 | $600,000 | $500,000 (capped) |

### Liquidation Mechanics

The protocol employs a dynamic liquidation system to protect the lending pool and preserve revenue generation:

```rust
pub fn check_liquidation(user_address: Pubkey) -> bool {
    let collateral_value = get_collateral_value(user_address);
    let borrowed_amount = get_borrowed_amount(user_address);
    let health_factor = collateral_value / borrowed_amount;
    
    // Liquidation triggers when health factor falls below 1.0
    // At 60% LTV, there's a 40% safety cushion before liquidation
    if health_factor < 1.0 {
        execute_liquidation(user_address);
        return true;
    }
    false
}

pub fn execute_liquidation(user_address: Pubkey) {
    let collateral = get_collateral(user_address);
    let borrowed_amount = get_borrowed_amount(user_address);
    
    // Sell collateral to repay debt
    let sale_proceeds = sell_collateral(collateral);
    
    // Repay loan
    repay_loan(borrowed_amount);
    
    // ALL surplus is redistributed back to the protocol
    if sale_proceeds > borrowed_amount {
        let surplus = sale_proceeds - borrowed_amount;
        
        // Surplus is treated as revenue and split:
        // 50% → Holder Rewards
        // 50% → Chart Buyback Support
        redistribute_liquidation_surplus(surplus);
    }
}
```

**Liquidation Example:**
- User borrowed: $6,000 USD against 100,000 Exen tokens (worth $10,000)
- Token price drops to $0.09 (collateral now worth $9,000)
- Liquidation triggers when price reaches $0.0833 (collateral worth $8,333)
- Liquidated collateral sells for $8,333
- Loan repaid: $6,000
- **Surplus: $2,333** → 50% to holder rewards, 50% to chart buyback

### Interest Revenue Flow

#### Daily Revenue Cycle

```
Lending Interest Accrued Daily
    │
    ├─→ 50% Holder Rewards Distribution
    │   ├─→ Converted to SOL
    │   ├─→ Distributed to all token holders
    │   ├─→ 15-minute cycles
    │   └─→ Proportional to holdings
    │
    └─→ 50% Chart Buyback Support
        ├─→ Accumulated for optimal entry points
        ├─→ RSI/MACD signal confirmation
