# 🧠 Exen Protocol Strategy Documentation v2

## Executive Summary

The Exen Protocol implements a revolutionary three-pillar system that simultaneously rewards token holders with SOL distributions, maintains chart health through algorithmic buybacks, and enables a sustainable lending ecosystem. This creates a multi-layer value generation system where community rewards, technical performance, and financial utility work in harmony.

## 🎯 Core Strategy: The 25/25/50 Split

### Philosophy
We've evolved beyond simple holder rewards to create a complete ecosystem. By strategically allocating fees across immediate holder value, chart stability, and lending infrastructure, we build a self-sustaining protocol that benefits all participants.

### Implementation
```
Total Creator Fees (100%)
├── 25% → Direct Holder Rewards (SOL Airdrops)
├── 25% → Algorithmic Chart Buyback Support
└── 50% → Lending Pool Infrastructure
```

## 💰 Reward Engine (25% of Fees)

### Distribution Mechanism
- **Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- **Currency**: SOL (Solana native token)
- **Eligibility**: All token holders (no minimum threshold)
- **Calculation**: Proportional to token holdings

### How the Rewards Are Split

Think of it like a pie. Each reward cycle, that 25% of creator fees becomes a whole pie that gets divided among all holders. The bigger your slice of the total token supply, the bigger your slice of that SOL pie.

- Hold **50% of the supply**? You get **50% of the rewards pie** 🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧
- Hold **25% of the supply**? You get **25% of the rewards pie** 🥧🥧🥧
- Hold **10% of the supply**? You get **10% of the rewards pie** 🥧

It's perfectly proportional. Your share of the rewards matches your share of the token supply - simple, fair, and transparent.

### Real Example

Let's say there are 4 holders and the rewards pot has **2.5 SOL** to distribute (25% allocation of a 10 SOL fee):

| Holder | Token Supply % | SOL Reward |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| 1st Holder | 50% | 1.25 SOL (50% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 2nd Holder | 25% | 0.625 SOL (25% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 3rd Holder | 15% | 0.375 SOL (15% of 2.5 SOL) |
| 4th Holder | 10% | 0.25 SOL (10% of 2.5 SOL) |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **2.50 SOL** ✓ |

### Smart Contract Logic
```rust
// Reward distribution for 25% allocation
pub fn distribute_rewards() {
    let total_fees = get_creator_fees();
    let reward_pool = total_fees * 0.25; // 25% for rewards
    
    for holder in token_holders {
        let holder_balance = get_balance(holder);
        let total_supply = get_total_supply();
        let reward_amount = (holder_balance / total_supply) * reward_pool;
        
        transfer_sol(holder, reward_amount);
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Immediate Value**: Holders see returns within 15 minutes
- **No Staking Required**: Passive income for all holders
- **Transparent**: All distributions on-chain
- **Compound Effect**: Rewards can be reinvested

## 📈 Chart Buyback Engine (25% of Fees)

### Technical Analysis Framework

#### 1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) Analysis
```python
def calculate_rsi(prices, period=14):
    """Calculate RSI for momentum analysis"""
    deltas = np.diff(prices)
    gains = np.where(deltas > 0, deltas, 0)
    losses = np.where(deltas < 0, -deltas, 0)
    
    avg_gains = np.mean(gains[-period:])
    avg_losses = np.mean(losses[-period:])
    
    rs = avg_gains / avg_losses if avg_losses != 0 else 0
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

# RSI thresholds for buy signals
RSI_OVERSOLD = 30
RSI_OVERSOLD_STRONG = 20
RSI_NEUTRAL = 50
```

#### 2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
```python
def calculate_macd(prices, fast=12, slow=26, signal=9):
    """Calculate MACD for trend analysis"""
    ema_fast = calculate_ema(prices, fast)
    ema_slow = calculate_ema(prices, slow)
    
    macd_line = ema_fast - ema_slow
    signal_line = calculate_ema(macd_line, signal)
    histogram = macd_line - signal_line
    
    return macd_line, signal_line, histogram

# MACD buy signals
MACD_BULLISH_CROSS = "macd_line > signal_line"
MACD_HISTOGRAM_POSITIVE = "histogram > 0"
```

#### 3. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
```python
def analyze_timeframes(price_data):
    """Analyze 1m and 5m timeframes for confirmation"""
    rsi_1m = calculate_rsi(price_data['1m'], 14)
    rsi_5m = calculate_rsi(price_data['5m'], 14)
    
    macd_1m = calculate_macd(price_data['1m'])
    macd_5m = calculate_macd(price_data['5m'])
    
    # Confirmation required from both timeframes
    return {
        'rsi_confirmed': rsi_1m < 30 and rsi_5m < 35,
        'macd_confirmed': macd_1m['bullish'] and macd_5m['bullish'],
        'buy_signal': rsi_confirmed and macd_confirmed
    }
```

### Buyback Execution Algorithm
```python
def execute_support_buyback():
    """Execute algorithmic buyback when conditions are met"""
    analysis = analyze_timeframes(get_price_data())
    
    if analysis['buy_signal']:
        # Calculate buy amount based on available funds
        available_funds = get_buyback_support_funds()
        buy_amount = calculate_optimal_buy_size(available_funds)
        
        # Execute buy order
        execute_buy_order(buy_amount)
        
        # Log transaction for transparency
        log_support_buyback(buy_amount, analysis)
```

### Risk Management
- **Maximum Buy Size**: 10% of available buyback funds per trade
- **Cooldown Period**: 5 minutes between consecutive buys
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic if RSI > 70 (overbought territory)
- **High Volatility**: Reduce position sizes by 50%
- **Low Liquidity**: Pause automated buybacks

## 🏦 Lending Pool System (50% of Fees)

### Lending Pool Infrastructure

#### Pool Activation & Mechanics
- **Minimum Liquidity Threshold**: $50,000 USD equivalent
- **Pool Status**: Inactive until threshold is reached, then auto-activates
- **Funding Source**: 50% of all creator fees continuously added
- **Currency**: Loans issued in USD stablecoin

#### How the Lending Pool Works

The lending pool operates on a collateral-based lending model where Exen token holders can leverage their holdings for liquidity.

**Step 1: Deposit Collateral**
Users deposit Exen tokens into the lending contract as collateral. These tokens are locked and held in escrow.

**Step 2: Borrow USD**
Based on their collateral amount, users can borrow USD stablecoin up to their borrow limit. The protocol calculates maximum borrow amounts based on collateral value and risk parameters.

**Step 3: Price Movement Scenarios**

**Scenario A: Exen Price Decreases**
- User borrowed: 1,000 USD against 10,000 Exen tokens (worth $1,000)
- Current price: Exen now worth $0.08 (down from $0.10)
- Current collateral value: 10,000 × $0.08 = $800
- **User obligation**: Still owes 1,000 USD
- **Resolution**: User repays 1,000 USD and receives their 10,000 Exen tokens back
- **Surplus handling**: The collateral ($800) is insufficient. The protocol covers the $200 loss from lending reserves, and that $200 is directed back into the chart buyback system for price recovery

**Scenario B: Exen Price Increases**
- User borrowed: 1,000 USD against 10,000 Exen tokens (worth $1,000)
- Current price: Exen now worth $0.12 (up from $0.10)
- Current collateral value: 10,000 × $0.12 = $1,200
- **User obligation**: Still owes 1,000 USD
- **Resolution**: User repays 1,000 USD and receives their 10,000 Exen tokens back
- **Surplus handling**: The extra $200 ($1,200 - $1,000) stays with the protocol and is added back to the lending pool, making it more robust

### Per-User Borrow Limits

Each user has an individual borrow limit calculated based on their collateral deposit and protocol parameters:

```rust
pub fn calculate_borrow_limit(collateral_amount: u64) -> u64 {
    let collateral_value_usd = get_current_token_price() * collateral_amount;
    let collateral_ratio = 0.75; // Users can borrow up to 75% of collateral value
    
    let max_borrow = (collateral_value_usd * collateral_ratio) as u64;
    
    // Cap per-user limit to prevent concentration risk
    let per_user_cap = 500_000; // $500k USD max per user
    
    min(max_borrow, per_user_cap)
}
```

**Example Borrow Limits:**

| Collateral Deposited | Token Price | Collateral Value | Max Borrow (75%) | Actual Limit |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 100,000 Exen | $0.10 | $10,000 | $7,500 | $7,500 |
| 1,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $100,000 | $75,000 | $75,000 |
| 5,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $500,000 | $375,000 | $375,000 |
| 10,000,000 Exen | $0.10 | $1,000,000 | $750,000 | $500,000 (capped) |

### Liquidation Mechanics

The protocol employs a dynamic liquidation system to protect the lending pool:

```rust
pub fn check_liquidation(user_address: Pubkey) -> bool {
    let collateral_value = get_collateral_value(user_address);
    let borrowed_amount = get_borrowed_amount(user_address);
    let health_factor = collateral_value / borrowed_amount;
    
    // Liquidation triggers when health factor falls below 1.0
    if health_factor < 1.0 {
        execute_liquidation(user_address);
        return true;
    }
    false
}

pub fn execute_liquidation(user_address: Pubkey) {
    let collateral = get_collateral(user_address);
    let borrowed_amount = get_borrowed_amount(user_address);
    
    // Sell collateral to repay debt
    let sale_proceeds = sell_collateral(collateral);
    
    // Repay loan
    repay_loan(borrowed_amount);
    
    // Return surplus to user or redirect excess to pool
    if sale_proceeds > borrowed_amount {
        let surplus = sale_proceeds - borrowed_amount;
        add_to_lending_pool(surplus);
    }
}
```

### Smart Contract Logic
```rust
pub struct LendingPool {
    pub pool_balance: u64,  // USD stablecoin
    pub total_borrowed: u64,
    pub minimum_threshold: u64, // $50,000
    pub is_active: bool,
}

impl LendingPool {
    pub fn deposit_fees(&mut self, amount: u64) {
        self.pool_balance += amount;
        
        if self.pool_balance >= self.minimum_threshold && !self.is_active {
            self.is_active = true;
        }
    }
    
    pub fn user_deposit_collateral(&mut self, user: Pubkey, exen_amount: u64) {
        if !self.is_active {
            panic!("Lending pool not yet active");
        }
        
        lock_exen_collateral(user, exen_amount);
        record_user_collateral(user, exen_amount);
    }
    
    pub fn user_borrow_usd(&mut self, user: Pubkey, borrow_amount: u64) {
        let max_borrow = calculate_borrow_limit(user);
        require!(borrow_amount <= max_borrow, "Exceeds borrow limit");
        require!(borrow_amount <= self.pool_balance, "Insufficient pool liquidity");
        
        transfer_usd_to_user(user, borrow_amount);
        record_user_debt(user, borrow_amount);
        self.pool_balance -= borrow_amount;
        self.total_borrowed += borrow_amount;
    }
    
    pub fn user_repay_loan(&mut self, user: Pubkey, repay_amount: u64) {
        let user_debt = get_user_debt(user);
        require!(repay_amount <= user_debt, "Repayment exceeds debt");
        
        receive_usd_from_user(user, repay_amount);
        reduce_user_debt(user, repay_amount);
        
        if user_debt - repay_amount == 0 {
            // User fully repaid - return collateral
            let collateral_amount = get_user_collateral(user);
            release_exen_collateral(user, collateral_amount);
            clear_user_collateral(user);
        }
        
        self.pool_balance += repay_amount;
        self.total_borrowed -= repay_amount;
    }
}
```

### Lending Pool Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Accumulation (Pre-Activation)**
- Fees flow into pool
- Pool displays countdown to $50k threshold
- Community can monitor progress

**Phase 2: Activation**
- Pool reaches $50,000 minimum
- Lending becomes available
- Users can deposit collateral and borrow

**Phase 3: Growth**
- Continuous 50% fee allocation grows the pool
- Surplus from price recoveries reinvests
- Pool becomes self-reinforcing
