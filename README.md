## 🎯 What Makes Us Different

While other projects either reward holders OR support their chart, we do **both simultaneously** through an innovative 50/50 fee split system that creates sustainable value for the entire community.

### ⚡ Real-Time Rewards
- **SOL airdrops every 15 minutes** to all holders
- **No staking required** - just hold and earn
- **Transparent distribution** based on token holdings

### 📈 Intelligent Chart Support
- **Algorithmic buy pressure** using advanced technical analysis
- **RSI, MACD, and multi-timeframe analysis** for optimal entry points
- **Automated support** at key technical levels

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Creator Fees (100%)
├── 50% → Direct SOL Rewards to Holders (Every 15 min)
└── 50% → Algorithmic Chart Support System
    ├── RSI Analysis (1m & 5m timeframes)
    ├── MACD Momentum Detection
    └── Automated Buy Execution
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
